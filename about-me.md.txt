# About Me

Hello! I’m Jonathan Jefferies, a fitness enthusiast and health-conscious individual dedicated to managing my well-being through thoughtful, consistent exercise. Managing gout has been a significant part of my fitness journey, and I’ve developed routines that allow me to stay active while minimizing flare-ups and joint discomfort.

## My Fitness Philosophy

I believe in the power of movement and consistency. My approach combines:

- **Low-impact exercises** that protect my joints and reduce inflammation.
- A balanced routine focusing on **mobility, strength, cardiovascular health, and balance**.
- Exercising **five days a week** with dedicated rest days to allow proper recovery.
- Tracking progress carefully through data and visuals, which helps me stay motivated and adjust my plan as needed.

## My Custom Gout Exercise Tracker

To support my journey, I built a personalized exercise tracker web app that offers:

- A **4-week gout-friendly workout plan** with daily routines for Monday through Friday.
- **Color-coded days** for easy navigation and quick reference.
- Interactive **pie charts to visualize exercise distribution** and monitor progress over time.
- A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** setup that allows me to install the tracker on my mobile device or desktop and use it offline — perfect for workouts anywhere, anytime.

## Technology Stack

I enjoy building tools that empower health and fitness through technology, including:

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Chart.js** for dynamic and attractive data visualization.
- **Service Workers** to enable offline functionality.
- Implementing **PWA features** for an app-like experience without the need to visit app stores.
